The primary reason for SCTP's scarcity is, in my opinion, that SCTP is relatively new.  It can't be reliably used to move data to a PC or mobile endpoint because it is not generally available in PC/Mobile OS networking stacks.  It is available as an extension to Linux, FreeBSD, Mac, and most other 'Nixes.  I don't think there is anything available for Windows.  The secondary reason is that SCTP could have a disastrous effect on router companies who have spent years, and billions of dollars, making proprietary improvements to TCP.

There is a mountain of problems with TCP that SCTP could help mitigate.  Frankly, it is probably going to succeed TCP at some point, in the same sense that IPv6 will succeed IPv4 at some point.  TCP is point-to-point only, and it's rigid in the way that it transforms application data into network data (and vice versa).  So, in recent times there have been quite a few attempts to workaround security and throughput limitations of TCP.  From a networking perspective, these could be considered hacks, but they are necessary to allow TCP to handle modern volumes of information.
